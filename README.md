# SMT203Proj-preliminary-version-

This repository contains the preliminary version-only the backend development and before integration with telegram bot API (which serves as the user interface of our solution) of the Singapore Management University (SMU) School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) SMT203-Smart City Management and Systems course project. For this project, the team aim to create a Telegram bot to assist SMU undergraduates on finding and connecting with fellow SMU peers for overseas exchange programs.
